#PTMSCPrototype

Drive the pinto abalone exhibition prototype simulating a scuba diver doing abalone outplanting using a "flying camera" mechanism simiar in principle to the cameras on four cables the NFL uses to "fly" over the field (technically called a "cable-driven parallel robot"). The prototype is intended to work out the kinks in the mechanism and its control before building the real thing.
